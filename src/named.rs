//! Declare menu navigation through [`Name`].
//!
//! The most difficult part of the API when creating UI scenes,
//! was using [`MenuBuilder::EntityParent`],
//! providing the [`Entity`] for the [`Focusable`] the menu is reachable from,
//! forced users to separate and order the creation of their menus.
//!
//! *By-name declaration* let you simply add a [`Name`] to your [`Focusable`]
//! and refer to it in [`MenuBuilder::NamedParent`].
//!
//! The runtime then detects labelled stuff
//! and replace the partial [`MenuBuilder`]
//! with the full [`TreeMenu`] with the proper entity id reference.
//! This saves you from pre-spawning your buttons
//! so that you can associate their `id` with the proper submenu.
//!
//! [`TreeMenu`]: crate::resolve::TreeMenu
